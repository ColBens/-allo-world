Test repo

Here to sharpen skills in code and automation to better communicate with team members, and to better serve the members I manage by being able to do and understand what I ask of them.
Aside from that, I love games, coffee, music, fitness, animation, cinematic television, and film-all kinds. Above all, wife, family and bear hugs.
